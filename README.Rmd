# CTSM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The Cum-Time Stacking Model is an ensemble algorithm based on cumulative time series. The core idea is to divide the time series into l (a positive integer greater than or equal to 2) cumulative time series to capture data information at different time scales. Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is used for feature construction, which performs better compared to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Autoencoders.

The research conducted in this project is based on the preprint paper titled "A Cum-Time-Based Machine Leaning Algorithm for Predicting Sepsis Onset in MIMIC IV".

## Installation

You can install the development version of CTSM like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Xingyu-stars/CTSM")
```

## Example

Here is a basic example that illustrates how to use CTSM to divide the cumulative time series, extract features, and make predictions

```{r example}
# library(CTSM)
# library(keras3)
# library(tensorflow)
# library(tidyverse)
# library(dplyr)
# library(caret)
# library(caTools)
# library(rpart)
# library(caretEnsemble)
# library(pROC)
# library(reticulate)
# library(kernlab)

## basic example code
data(eg_sep_data)
data(eg_nonsep_data)
n_var <- ncol(data)
n_hadm <- length(unique(data$hadm_id))

pre_time <- 3
lookback_time <- c(2,4,6,8,10)

# data_raw <- data_func(data,data0,pre_time,lookback_time)
# data_feature <- data_feature_func_KPCA(data_raw,lookback_time)
# data_stacking <- stacking_func(data_feature,lookback_time)
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
